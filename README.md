# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Features

- Difficulty system that gradually increases, all cards are shuffled for each round with 2 unclicked cards appearing for each round, 1 card for hard difficulty.
- Sound design, implementation of themed music where the tempo gets faster as the user is continuing the game.
- Sound effects for clickable elements (btns and cards)

<!-- ADD WIN SCREEN -->
<!-- Make sure there is atleast one card not choosen for each difficulty -->
<!-- Change text-select color -->
<!-- import fallback formats audio if the primary audio isn't imported -->
